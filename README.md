binary-primes
=============

Scripts to generate graphical binary representations of prime numbers

For more information see my blog: http://exponentialdecay.co.uk/blog/data-as-art-art-as-culture 
and http://exponentialdecay.co.uk/blog/binary-prime-numbers-with-added-code/

Requires: Python Image Library - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

####TODO:

Handling of the tiled image is a bit messed up as I combined two scripts rather hastily. I need
to figure out a way to dynamically handle the generation of this image, but I need to put my
maths head on first.
